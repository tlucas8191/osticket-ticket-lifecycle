In the assignment and communication stage, tickets are passed on to a specific agent by the helpdesk administrator and then assigned a priority listing and SLA plan by the agent.

<p>
In the last stage of the ticket lifecycle, the team/agent comes to resolution and action steps are taken towards the completion of the resolution.  The resolution is then communicated to the end-user that put in the ticket.
